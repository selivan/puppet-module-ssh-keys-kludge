Puppet module for managing ssh keys. Works only for existing users. Convinient for simple cases.

Made for training, but tested and runnable.

Keys are stored in files directory, key file name = username.

Custom fact is used to detect user's home directory.

**P.S.** If this code is useful for you - don't forget to put a star on it's [github repo](https://github.com/selivan/puppet-module-ssh-keys-kludge).
